## Machine Learning

### Solutions

- [Python introduction](./notebooks/lab1.ipynb), 9/10

> - In third task rounding is necessary
> - In five task need to make precision more

- [Pandas introduction](./notebooks/lab2.ipynb), 12/12
- [Linear regression 1](./notebooks/lab3_1.ipynb), 6/6
- [Linear regression 2](), 0/6
- [Decision trees and random forests](./notebooks/lab4.ipynb), 7/12

> - Work done correct, but I answered it so bad, because of that final score is so low

- [Work with text](./notebooks/lab5.ipynb), 11/12

> - The lower bound for TFIdf and dictionary n-grams must be 1.
> - The upper bound for character n-grams must be higher.

- [Neuron training](./notebooks/lab6_1.ipynb)
- [Activation functions](./notebooks/lab6_2.ipynb)

> Final score is 8/12
> - It is better to implement `predict` as a separate method
> - 6.2 not completed, no check for `voice` dataset

### Tests

- [K-Nearest Neighbors](./tests/test1.ipynb) - 6/11 points
- [Neural Networks](./tests/test2.ipynb) - 4/11 points
