## Solutions

- [Python introduction](python/intro.ipynb), 9/10

> - In third task rounding is necessary
> - In five task need to make precision more

- [Pandas introduction](pandas/pandas.ipynb), 12/12
- [Linear regression 1](linear-regression/linear-regression-v1.ipynb), 6/6
- [Linear regression 2](), 0/6
- [Decision trees and random forests](trees/trees-forest.ipynb), 7/12

> - Work done correct, but I answered it so bad, because of that final score is so low

- [Work with text](text/text.ipynb), 11/12

> - The lower bound for TFIdf and dictionary n-grams must be 1.
> - The upper bound for character n-grams must be higher.

- [Neuron training](neural-networks/neuron-training.ipynb)
- [Activation functions](neural-networks/activation-fn.ipynb)

> Final score is 8/12
> - It is better to implement `predict` as a separate method
> - 6.2 not completed, no check for `voice` dataset

- [PyTorch. Image classification](), 0/12

## Tests

- [K-Nearest Neighbors](linear-regression/k-nearest-neighbors.ipynb) - 6/11 points
- [Neural Networks](neural-networks/neural-networks.ipynb) - 4/11 points
