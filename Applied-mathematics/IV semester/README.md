## Solutions

> All solutions are written in Python with a lot of non-standard things, such as `decorators`, `garbage logic`.

> The first two problems work correct in 99% of cases, having a great `mathplotlib` plots and `pandas` stats.
> 
> The last two one may have bugs, sometimes works so unoptimized + they have incorrect description of the problems.
