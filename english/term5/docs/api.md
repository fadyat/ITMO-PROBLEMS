You can use the API to create bots that can perform a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, sending notifications, or managing groups.

Once you have your API token, you can use it to authenticate your API requests and start building your bot. The API provides a range of methods that you can use to interact with users and perform different tasks.

```golang

func main() {
	// Set up the bot API and get the bot's updates channel
	bot, err := tgbotapi.NewBotAPI("YOUR_API_TOKEN")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Set up the bot's update configuration
	updateConfig := tgbotapi.NewUpdate(0)
	updateConfig.Timeout = 60
	updates, err := bot.GetUpdatesChan(updateConfig)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Process updates as they come in
	for update := range updates {
		if update.Message == nil {
			continue
		}

		// Print the incoming message to the console
		fmt.Printf("[%s] %s\n", update.Message.From.UserName, update.Message.Text)

		// Send a response message back to the user
		responseMessage := tgbotapi.NewMessage(update.Message.Chat.ID, "Hello, I am a bot!")
		bot.Send(responseMessage)
	}
}
