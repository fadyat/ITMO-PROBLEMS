Hi Lev,

I would like to apologize for the delay in completing this task. I understand that this has caused inconvenience for the rest of the team, and I take full responsibility for the delay.
I am writing to let you know that I have made significant progress in setting up the CI/CD configuration. I have already set up the GitHub repository and I am currently working on the configuration. I am confident that I will be able to complete this task before the end of the day.
I appreciate your patience and understanding while I work to complete this task.
I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know when the task is complete.

Artyom

Dear Lev,

During our last meeting, we agreed that you would be responsible for the theoretical part of your project. However, I noticed that you have not yet completed this task, which is becoming a bottleneck for the rest of the team.

If you are facing any challenges or obstacles in completing the task, please let me know. I am here to help, and we can work together to overcome any difficulties.

Best regards, Artyom
