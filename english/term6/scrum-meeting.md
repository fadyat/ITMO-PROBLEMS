### Agenda for Scrum Meeting:

- Review of previous sprint's goals and accomplishments
- Discussion of any issues encountered during the previous sprint
- Presentation of the completed formal report on reverse proxy and caching
- Planning for the next sprint

### What we have done so far:

During the previous sprint, we focused on creating a formal report on our findings related to reverse proxy and caching. We used the documentation we created in the previous sprint as a basis for the report and expanded on the information to provide more detail. We also worked on formatting and styling to make the report look professional.

### What problems we ran into and how we've solved them/how we are going to solve them/if we need help:

We did not encounter any major problems during the previous sprint. However, we did have some minor issues with formatting and styling the report. We were able to resolve these issues by collaborating and sharing ideas on how to best present the information.

### Our plan for the next sprint:

During the next sprint, we plan to focus on implementing load balancing. Load balancing will help distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and ensure high availability. We will be working on configuring and testing load balancing on our reverse proxy server. We will also be monitoring server performance to ensure that it can handle the additional load.
