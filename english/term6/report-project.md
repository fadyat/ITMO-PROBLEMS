### Section 1: Activities and Progress

1.1 Implementation/ development progress:

The implementation and development of the proxy server have been progressing steadily. The team has completed the core functionality of the server, including the ability to handle requests, forward requests to the appropriate backend server, and return responses to clients. The team has also implemented caching and load-balancing features to improve performance.

1.2 Testing progress:

The team has conducted unit testing on critical components of the proxy server. However, the testing coverage is currently limited, with no integration testing conducted yet. The team is working on expanding the testing coverage and integrating testing into the CI/CD pipeline.

1.3 Deviations from proposed architecture and design:

There have been a few deviations from the proposed architecture and design. The team decided to use Protobuf as the serialization format instead of JSON due to its better performance and efficiency.

### Section 2: Risks, Issues and Challenges

The team has identified a few risks, issues, and challenges that need to be addressed:

- Limited testing coverage: The team needs to expand the testing coverage to ensure the proxy server is stable and reliable under different scenarios and configurations.
Scalability: The team is currently working on improving the scalability of the proxy server to handle large volumes of traffic.

- Security: The team ensures the proxy server is secure by implementing proper authentication and encryption
measures.

### Section 3: Next Steps

The team's next steps include:

- Expanding the testing coverage to include integration testing and automated testing integrated into the
CI/CD pipeline.
- Refining and optimizing the caching and compression features to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
Implementing content filtering to block unwanted or malicious content.
- Improving the scalability of the proxy server to handle larger volumes of traffic.
- Continuing to test and refine the security measures.
