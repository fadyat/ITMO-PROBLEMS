I am pleased to inform you that we have made significant progress since our last update. We have successfully configured and tested the reverse proxy server and it is now fully functional. Additionally, we have implemented several security measures to ensure that the server is secure from potential attacks.

However, we have encountered some issues during the implementation phase. One issue we faced was configuring the server to handle high-traffic loads. We had to optimize the server's configuration and implement load-balancing techniques to ensure it could handle a high number of requests without crashing.

Unfortunately, this issue caused a delay in our project timeline. We are currently behind schedule by approximately one week. However, we are confident that we can complete the project by the defense deadline of the end of April.

To ensure that we finish the project on time, we have created a detailed plan to complete the remaining tasks. We will be working closely with each other to ensure that we are on track to meet the project deadline. We will also be regularly testing and monitoring the server to ensure that it is working optimally.

Thank you for your understanding and support throughout this project. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
